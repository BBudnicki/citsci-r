# citsci

[CitSci.org](https://CitSci.org) is a citizen science platform for collecting scientific observations from the community. This R library is for accessing the [CitSci.org API](https://api.citsci.org/). It will mostly be used for authentication & retrieving observations. This is in very early development & will contain bugs.  Additional developer information can be found at [citsci.org/developers](https://citsci.org/developers).



## Getting Started

General steps to use this library

- Installation of this package
- Register for CitSci.org Account
- Get API Key
- Identify data you wish to download

### Installation

** This package is hosted in this GitHub repository & is not available directly from CRAN.

``` r
package.install('citsci')
libaray('citsci')
```


### Register for CitSci.org Account

- [https://citsci.org/register](https://citsci.org/register)
- Verify your email address

### Get API key

This is manually done by Brandon. Please email budnicki@colostate.edu

### Identify data you wish to download

Project privacy may be Public or Private. Public projects do not require you to be a member to download data. Private projects require you to be a member. If you are not a member, request to join the project.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(citsci)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


## Design & Development

- [x] Write Readme documentation
- [ ] Organize files
- [ ] Create login helper [Allow user to config API key ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)
- [ ] Query observations API
  - [ ] Start with Datasheet ID
  - [ ]Expand to Project ID
  - [ ]Define filters (Date)
